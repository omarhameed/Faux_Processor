/**

 * @brief XME File Loader for ECED3403 Assignment 1 Emulator
 *
 * This module contains functionality to read S-Record formatted files,
 * extracting and decoding necessary information such as record type,
 * data length, address and data. This information is used to populate
 * memory and setup the initial program counter (PC) for the emulator.
 *
 * Note: Only S0, S1, and S9 records are supported.
 *
 * This is part of the coursework for ECED3403 - Computer Architecture, Assignment 1.

 *   Purpose:
 *          Opens a .XME file and loads it into memory. If no file is provided via command-line
 *          arguments, it prompts the user for a file name. If the file fails to open, it allows
 *          for retry up to three times. It calls ReadFile() function for reading the file content.
 *  Parameters:
 *          int argc: number of strings pointed to by argv.
 *          char* argv[]: command-line arguments.
